# Hi ðŸ‘‹, dear reader!

Feel free to fork into the respositories here. The nice acts of collaboration and sharing are always welcome.  

To prioritise realisable ideas (SMART goals) and realise the top three, I rate them with-
- feasibility study,
- absolute value proposition,
- cost in terms of effort and time, and 
- value for money (the returns against risk & investment). RoRI = RoR + RoI

![Prometheus-Grafana Dashboard of Order-Manager](./Prometheus-Grafana-Dashboard-of-Order-Manager.png)


## ðŸ”­ By now I have mainly developed [HCM function of Employee onboarding and training induction under ERP](https://github.com/rishiraj88/EmployeeOnboardingStateMachine/tree/main), [Vehicle Leasing Contract](https://github.com/rishiraj88/leasing) and [e-Commerce Order Manager](https://github.com/rishiraj88/order-manager). One-liners about these projects
- Employee Onboarding demonstrates the coherent sequencing of various tasks, which are performed while welcoming a new person on board (after the acceptance of job offer). These tasks include selection and assignment of and training workflows as well as updating the personal details of the persons in Human Capital Management (HCM) module of a modern ERP system.
- `Vehicle Leasing Contract` is a Self-Help Portal for the customers to take vehicles on lease, to abide by in-force lease-contract policies and to return the vehicles to dealers. The portal is for use only by end-customers. 
- On the other hand, `Order Manager` demonstrates the technological collaboration of Kubernetes clustering with Kafka Message Queuing. On functional side, it is an implementation of the core functionalities of Order module of any modern e-commerce or marketplace platform. It encompasses the synchronous communication between Order and Inventory to check in-stock status of items, and asynchronous communication between Order and Notification (flexible for Email, Push and more modes). Product details are fetched from Product module.
- In common, these applications have been developed using RESTful APIs and Microservice architecture, ready to containerize and deploy in cloud and data centers.

## New Capabilities and PoC's
- Implementation of Message Queues with Kafka being the message broker.
- Orchestration of Microservices in Docker containers using Kubernetes (with YML-powered declarations.
- One more parallel attempt is to add a few apps built with Kotlin.

- I am making deliberate use of the beneficial features of Java 17 and higher versions, such as Record type, switch expression, HttpClient along with the very popular Stream API, Date/Time API and Optional. And, yes, the superpowers of the already tremendous Java 8 facilities have been further bolstered in the later releases of the language (canonically known as JLS: the Java Language Specification).

## ðŸŒ± Alongside Iâ€™m fostering myself with more of: "all things containers" and orchestration, such as
- Docker networking across OSI Model layers of networks,
- hosting the containers in cloud infrastructure as well as in virtual networks,
- orchestrating clusters using Kubernetes, local registries and IaC tools, and
- Apache NiFi for data flow and application testing.

## ðŸ¤” I have always been curious about Green Development by enhancing system performance. To me, the easiest approach to achieve Sustainability is:
- to write highly performant applications, services and platforms.
- In case I fall short of the SME level of expertise regarding some tools, I rely on the promises of the respective providers. They include the leading cloud service providers.

... for learners and seekers to refer quickly.

## A. My Favorite Projects [highlighte at the top already]
I must not mix them among the others by enumerating. So, here are many, many repositories, gists and projects. ROLLING DRUMS!!!

### 1. Football World Cup Scoreboard [Scoreboard Easy to Customize for Other Game Genres](https://github.com/rishiraj88/footballWorldCupLiveScoreboard)

## 7. What's available in Java 21 API [Link](https://github.com/rishiraj88/JavaCoreSnippets/tree/main/Java21API)
New features available in Java 21 which we missed in Java 17 and earlier versions. Features, which are most notable and stand as the best candidates for frequent use, are listed below:
- Virtual threads (from Java 19)
![Virtual threads demo](./assets/java21/virtualthreads.png)
- Usage of `record` types in conditionals. Very useful with `if(reference instance Type)` tests.
<pre>if(publicParameter instanceof SpecificType) {}</pre>
- labels for `switch` cases. These are very similar to `instanceof` checks.
<pre>
case TierOne test -> future = test.callActionOne();
case TierTwo test -> future = test.callActionTwo();
</pre>
- String literals (a preview feature) to build parameterized text strings. These are similar to string literals / template strings of modern JavaScript and f-strings of python. The template processor `STR` is automatically imported and is available to use without any explicit import or declaration. More template processors include `RAW` and `FMT`. Remember `"fmt"` of Go (Golang)?
<pre>String vmUserName = localSystem.retrieveUserName();
String helloVitrualWorld = STR."Hola \{vmUserName}";</pre>
- One major pathchanger about Java Collection Framework is: the introduction of "sequenced collections": `SequencedCollection`, `SequencedSet` and `SequencedMap`.
<pre>
public interface SequencedCollection<E> extends Collection<E> // since 21
public interface SequencedMap<K, V> extends Map<K, V> // since 21
public interface SequencedSet<E> extends SequencedCollection<E>, Set<E> // since 21
</pre>
- My favorite as it is about security and encryption: Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEP) to secure symmetric keys.
- TODO: Add updated screenshots
- Implementation examples are in the project code under `Java21API` along with the checklist of which of the features have been tested.
