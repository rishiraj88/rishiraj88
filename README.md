# Hi  ðŸ‘‹, from Rishi Raj

I am always looking for colleagues and networkers to collect SMART ideas and realise the most promising ones of them, measured with-
- feasibility study
- absolute value proposition
- effort and time cost
- value-for-RI (risk & investment)

- ðŸ”­ Currently Iâ€™m working on [`leasing` project](https://github.com/rishiraj88/leasing). It is an End-User Utility to take vehicles on lease, respect such leasing contracts and returning the leased vehicles to providers. For use by customers (vehicle users).

- ðŸŒ± Alongside Iâ€™m learning the advanced concepts about containers and orchestration, mainly with respect to:
-- Docker networking,
-- hosting containers in cloud-infra services, and
-- orchestrating clusters using cloud-infra services and/or Kubernetes

- ðŸ¤” I have always been curious about slowing the pollution addition down by enhancing the performance of electrical and electronic devices alike. To me, the easiest to implement is:
-- to write highly performant applications, services and infrastructure.
-- In cases wherein I fall short of deep knowledge or device hardware, I rely upon the mercy of external providers. Thanks to the cloud service providers out there.

# Some of the Projects and Collections I have Prepared by Now
Code samples and PoC's
... for learners and seekers to refer quickly.

## 1. Spring Boot With Eureka (For Spring Cloud Architecture)
A project showcasing Eureka Service Discovery implemented for Microservices.
The following have been used here:
- Spring Boot v2.5.6
- Java 17
- Various dependencies for Microservices/modules

### Spring Boot and Java Specifications:
![Spring Boot and Java](https://github.com/rishiraj88/CodeSamples/blob/main/ContactsServiceDiscoveryWithSpingBootEureka/assets/images/Spring-Boot-and-Java-versions.jpg)


### Some of the dependencies for Gateway, Service Discovery Client and Actuator functionalities:
![dependencies](https://github.com/rishiraj88/CodeSamples/blob/main/ContactsServiceDiscoveryWithSpingBootEureka/assets/images/dependencies.jpg)

### Short Documentation
The URL to access API Gateway is:
http://localhost
Port for this is 80.

Two business microservices user-service and contact-service can be accessed at the socket of API Gateway:

**user-service:**
> http://localhost/user/2024

**contact-service:**
> http://localhost/contact/user/2024

This is the ease provided by Eureka Service Discovery and the implementation of API Gateway pattern for microservices architecture.

### Geek Note
Kindly ignore the spelling error in path name ('Sping') if you get to notice it.
`To err, to share, to get feedback <- my way of learning!`
