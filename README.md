# Hi  ðŸ‘‹, from Rishi Raj

I am always looking for colleagues and networkers to collect SMART ideas and realise the most promising ones of them, rated with-
- feasibility study
- absolute value proposition
- effort and time cost
- value for RI (risk & investment size)

- ðŸ”­ Currently Iâ€™m mainly developing on [Vehicle Leasing & Contract Manager](https://github.com/rishiraj88/leasing) and [Order Manager for e-Commerce](https://github.com/rishiraj88/order-manager). One-liners about these projects:
- `Contract Manager` is an End-User Self-Help Portal for the customers to take vehicles on lease, abide by in-force leasing contract policies and returning the leased vehicles to dealers. The portal is for use by customers (vehicle users) only. 
- On the other hand, `Order Manager` is the core set of modules to appreciate the mutual interactions of main services in the service sector of e-Commerce and Marketplaces.

## Upcoming PoC's
- Implementation of Message Queues with Kafka (priority 0)
- Orchestration of Microservices in Docker containers as Services and Tasks using Google Cloud (priority 1) and using AWS (priority 2)
- One more parallel attempt is to add Kotlin code to the active projects- by translating the older modules and/or by writing the newer modules straight away with Kotlin language. 

- I am making deliberate use of the beneficial features of Java 17 and higher versions, such as Record type, switch expression, HttpClient along with the "now popular" Stream API, DateTime API and Optional type. And, yes, the superpowers of the already tremendous Java 8 facilities have been further bolstered in the later releases of the language (JLS: the Java Language Specification).


- ðŸŒ± Alongside Iâ€™m learning the advanced concepts about containers and orchestration, mainly with respect to:
-- Docker networking,
-- hosting containers in cloud-infra services, and
-- orchestrating clusters using cloud-infra services and/or Kubernetes

- ðŸ¤” I have always been curious about slowing the pollution addition down by enhancing the performance of electrical and electronic devices alike. To me, the easiest to implement is:
-- to write highly performant applications, services and infrastructure.
-- In cases wherein I fall short of deep knowledge or device hardware, I rely upon the mercy of external providers. Thanks to the cloud service providers out there.

A comprehensive service for a multinational (or even global) company which operates in any financial domain. It is a service which allows consumers to calculate the net price of a product or service based on its gross price and the prevalent VAT (MWSt) rate. Our calculator also takes into consideration forex rates and performs the foreign currency conversions (foreign exchanges).

### 3. Leasing: Vehicle Leasing and Returning [Leasing](https://github.com/rishiraj88/leasing)
End-User Utility to take vehicles on lease, respect such leasing contracts and returning the leased vehicles to the providers. For use by customers (vehicle users).

- And, yes, continuous development and continuous integration are obviously good.
