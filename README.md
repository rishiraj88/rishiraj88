# Hi  ðŸ‘‹ to the dear reader!

Feel free to fork into and pull out of the respositories here. Collaboration and sharing are nice acts.  

To prioritise realisable ideas (SMART goals) and realise the top three, I rate them with-
- feasibility study,
- absolute value proposition,
- cost in terms of effort and time, and 
- value for money (the returns against risk & investment)

## ðŸ”­ By now I have mainly developed [Vehicle Leasing Contract](https://github.com/rishiraj88/leasing) and [e-Commerce Order Manager](https://github.com/rishiraj88/order-manager). One-liners about these projects

- `Vehicle Leasing Contract` is a Self-Help Portal for the customers to take vehicles on lease, abide by in-force leasing contract policies and return the leased vehicles to dealers. The portal is for use by customers only as being end users. 
- On the other hand, `Order Manager` is the implementation of the core functionalities of Order module of any modern e-commerce or marketplace platform.
- In common, these applications have been developed using RESTful APIs and Microservice architecture, ready to containerize and deploy in cloud and data centers.

## New Capabilities and PoC's

- Implementation of Message Queues with Kafka being the message broker.
- Orchestration of Microservices in Docker containers using Kubernetes (with YML-powered declarations.
- One more parallel attempt is to add a few apps built with Kotlin.

## I am making deliberate use of the beneficial features of Java 17 and higher versions, such as Record type, switch expression, HttpClient along with the very popular Stream API, Date/Time API and Optional. And, yes, the superpowers of the already tremendous Java 8 facilities have been further bolstered in the later releases of the language (canonically known as JLS: the Java Language Specification).

## ðŸŒ± Alongside Iâ€™m fostering myself with more of: "all things containers" and orchestration, such as
- Docker networking across OSI Model layers,
- hosting containers in cloud infrastructure, and
- orchestrating clusters using Kubernetes and IaC tools
- Apache NiFi for data flow and application testing

## ðŸ¤” I have always been curious about Green Development by enhancing system performance. To me, the easiest approach to achieve Sustainability is:

- to write highly performant applications, services and platforms.
- In case I fall short of the SME level of expertise regarding some tools, I rely on the promises of the respective providers. They include the leading cloud service providers.

It is a service which allows consumers to calculate the net price of a product or service based on its gross price and the prevalent VAT (MWSt) rate. Our calculator also takes into consideration forex rates and performs the foreign currency conversions (foreign exchanges).

### 3. Leasing: Vehicle Leasing and Returning [Leasing](https://github.com/rishiraj88/leasing)
End-User Utility to take vehicles on lease, respect such leasing contracts and returning the leased vehicles to the providers. For use by customers (vehicle users). Screenshots of the revamped UI to attach in next update.

- And, yes, continuous development and continuous integration are obviously good.
